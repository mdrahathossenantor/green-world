                <h4>Make a Futureproof Earth!</h4>
                <p>
                    As we move into the future, it is important that we take steps to ensure our planet remains
                    healthy and sustainable. Arecent study has shown that if we don't take action to preserve
                    the environment, our planet could facea 30% reduction in the number of species by the end
                    of the century. This is particularly concerning given that we are currently experiencing the
                    sixth mass extinction in the history of the planet!But before we rush off and start making
                    changes to our environment, we need to find effective ways of tackling these problems
                    without causing further damage. Thankfully, there are many things you can do to help
                    protect the future of our planet. <br><br>
                    <span>
                        Take One Step at a Time<br><br>
                    </span>

                    The first step is to start small-by taking small steps that are easy to implement and makea
                    huge impact. For example,you could reduce the amount of meat you consume or try
                    investing in renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. These small changes can
                    makeahuge difference when it comes to reducing our impact on the environment!<br><br>
                    <span>Protect earth by planting tree</span>
                    <br><br>
                    There are so many benefits to planting trees,and one of the most important is that they
                    protect earth.Trees take up space,and when they grow,they create shade which helps to
                    protect the ground from being scorched by the sun's rays,and prevent it from drying out
                    and becoming dusty.They also prevent erosion from taking place by preventing wind and
                    water from washing away the ground.But perhaps the most important aspect of their role is
                    that they provide oxygen for us to breathe,and they act as natural filters for air and water
                    pollution.Pollution causesahuge amount of damage to our ecosystems and our health,and
                    trees are our best weapon against it!

                <p class="p2">

                    <span>Plant a Tree</span><br><br>

                    Did you know that planting a tree can haveahuge impact on our planet? Trees produce
                    oxygen and provide habitat for animals who call the forest home. By planting trees you can
                    help combat deforestation and encourage biodiversity!Plant one tree today and help
                    supportahealthy future for our planet!<br><br>
                    <span>
                        Go Green at Home<br><br>
                    </span>

                    Another great way to protect the future of our planet is to go green at home! Start by
                    switching all of your household products to natural,non-toxic alternatives. You can also
                    install solar panels and energy-efficient appliances to reduce your energy bills.Small
                    changes like this can makeabig impact-and you'll feel great knowing that you're doing your
                    part to help protect the environment! <br /> <br />

                    <br /><br />
                    So don't wait-start planting trees today to help protect the environment and help us all
                    breathealittle easier.Plantingatree provides many benefits to the environment and also to
                    our community asawhole.Research has shown that there areanumber of benefits
                    associated with havingagreen space nearby that helps to reduce air pollution and create
                    healthier habitats for wildlife to thrive in.Trees help to reduce the impact of global warming
                    as they absorb carbon dioxide which is released into the atmosphere due to human
                    activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and producing electricity.

                        My name is Md. Rahat Hossen Antor and I am 18 years old. I was born the 1st of 3 children and
                        grew up in a family filled with soccer, games and exploration. Growing up as the First child I
                        learned to observe through the people and experiences that surrounded me. Over time my
                        understanding of empathy grew into a powerful emotion that drove my design. I am happiest when I
                        am playing sports or in the outdoors wandering and wondering about the world. <br> <br>
                        I completed Hifzul Quaran in Jamia Islamia Hafizia Madrasah from 2017-2019 and graduated with a
                        Bachelors of Science in Industrial Design. I am passionate about creating and innovating
                        products that beautifully and efficiently solve problems. I am forever curious and constantly
                        intrigued and inspired through web design, graphic design, typography, photography, and
                        architecture. I am driven to learn and push my creative boundaries and I am excited about the
                        opportunities that face me.
